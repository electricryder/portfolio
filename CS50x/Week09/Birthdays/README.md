# 🎂 Birthdays — CS50x Week 9 (Flask)

**Goal:** Build a Flask web application to store and display users’ birthdays, using an SQLite database for persistence.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Flask routes and view functions (`@app.route`)  
- Handling GET and POST requests with forms  
- Using **Jinja2 templates** for dynamic HTML  
- CRUD operations with **SQLite** via CS50’s SQL library  
- Application structure and separation of concerns

### ⚙️ Example Flow
1. User submits a name and birthday through a form  
2. Flask handles the POST request and stores data in `birthdays.db`  
3. The main page lists all birthdays dynamically from the database

### 🧩 Example
Name: Alice
Birthday: 2000-05-22

Displayed as:
🎂 Alice — May 22
