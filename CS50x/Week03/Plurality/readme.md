# 🗳 Plurality — CS50x Week 3

**Goal:** Simulate a simple election where each voter can vote for one candidate; the candidate with the most votes wins.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Structs (`typedef struct`) to represent candidates  
- Arrays and loops for data processing  
- Command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`)  
- Logic for tallying and finding maximum values

### 🧩 Example

./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 3
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Winner: Alice

### ⚙️ Compile & Run (CS50 environment)
```bash
make plurality
./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
```

What I Learned

Managing data with structs, validating input, and using loops to determine outcomes.
