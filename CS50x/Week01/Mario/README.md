# ðŸ§± Mario (More) â€“ CS50x Week 1

**Goal:** Print a pyramid of bricks using `#` symbols based on user input.

**Key concepts:**
- Loops and nested loops
- Input validation (`get_int`)
- ASCII characters and spacing

**Approach:**
Prompt the user for height (1â€“8).  
For each row, print the right number of spaces followed by hashes.

**Compile & run locally:**
```bash
gcc -o mario mario.c
./mario

**What I learned**
How to use nested loops and format text output in C.
I chose this exercise because, not only is the first one, but also because is show how something so simple can be so challenging in a lower lever language.
