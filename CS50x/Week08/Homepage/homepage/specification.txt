CS50x Problem Set 8 ‚Äî Homepage

Overview
This project is my personal homepage ‚Äî a small portfolio website built as part of CS50x‚Äôs Problem Set 8.
It introduces who I am, my professional background, and provides contact links.
The website is fully responsive, uses Bootstrap for layout and components, includes custom CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Structure
The project consists of four HTML pages and a shared CSS file (styles.css):

1. index.html ‚Äî The home page
   - Features a typing animation that reveals my name.
   - Displays a tagline that fades in smoothly after typing finishes.
   - Serves as the visual introduction to the site.

2. about.html ‚Äî ‚ÄúWho am I‚Äù page
   - Two main sections:
     - Career Objectives & Background: explains my transition from Electrical Engineering to Software Development.
     - Hobbies: describes my passion for music, with an accompanying image.
   - Uses Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system for a responsive two-column layout (image + text).

3. projects.html ‚Äî Projects placeholder
   - Currently marked ‚Äúüöß Under Development üöß‚Äù.
   - Includes a simple blinking animation using CSS keyframes.
   - Content centered vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.

4. contact.html ‚Äî Contacts & Links page
   - Displays my phone number, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.
   - Links are styled as rounded buttons with hover effects.
   - The phone number looks like a button but is not clickable.

In addition, both the header (banner + navbar) and footer are shared across all pages using JavaScript fetch() to load header.html and footer.html.

Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility and clarity.
- CSS3: Custom styling with transitions, animations, and color variables.
- Bootstrap 5.3: Used for layout grids, responsive utilities, and nav bar structure.
- JavaScript:
  - Typing animation on the home page.
  - fetch() to dynamically load shared header and footer.
- Flexbox: For vertical and horizontal centering of content.

Design Choices
- Color palette: Inspired by The Matrix ‚Äî black background (--vamp_blk) with shades of neon green (--green_1, --green_2, --green_3).
- Font: Monospace font (Consolas, Courier New) for a ‚Äúterminal‚Äù aesthetic.
- Layout: Consistent spacing and alignment using Bootstrap containers and Flexbox.
- Hover animations: Subtle effects on nav links, buttons, and images for interactivity.
- Footer: Fixed at the bottom with consistent theme styling.

Responsive Features
- All pages scale properly on desktops, tablets, and phones.
- Images and sections use relative units (vh, %, max-width) to adjust dynamically.
- Navbar and contact buttons wrap gracefully on small screens.
