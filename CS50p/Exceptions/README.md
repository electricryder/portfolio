### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `fuel.py` | Converts a fraction to a percentage; handles ZeroDivisionError and ValueError gracefully. |
| `grocery.py` | Stores grocery items and counts duplicates; handles EOF input termination. |
| `outdated.py` | Safely converts dates from “MM/DD/YYYY” or “Month DD, YYYY” formats. |
