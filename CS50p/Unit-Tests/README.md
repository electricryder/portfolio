# 🧪 CS50p — Unit Tests

**Goal:** Learn to design and run automated tests using `pytest` to ensure code correctness and reliability.

### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `bank.py` / `test_bank.py` | Tests polite vs. impolite greetings returning appropriate dollar values. |
| `fuel.py` / `test_fuel.py` | Tests fuel percentage conversion and boundary outputs (E/F). |
| `plates.py` / `test_plates.py` | Tests custom vanity plate validation for formatting and length. |
| `twttr.py` / `test_twttr.py` | Tests vowel removal logic for simplified social media text. |

### 💡 Key Concepts
- Writing tests with `pytest`  
- Using `assert` statements to verify behavior  
- Structuring test files (`test_*.py`)  
- Test-driven development (TDD) approach

### ▶️ Run examples
```bash
pytest -q
pytest test_fuel.py
pytest test_bank.py
```

### 💬 What I Learned
How to write repeatable, automated tests that verify code behavior, detect regressions early, and ensure program stability — essential for professional software development.
