### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `numb3rs.py` | Validates IPv4 addresses (0–255 range) using regex groups. |
| `watch.py` | Extracts YouTube video IDs from URLs like `https://youtu.be/...` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`. |
| `working.py` | Converts 12-hour time ranges (e.g., “9 AM to 5 PM”) into 24-hour format (`09:00 to 17:00`). |
| `response.py` | Validates proper email format and domain using regular expressions. |
