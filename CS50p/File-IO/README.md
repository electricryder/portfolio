# 📂 CS50p — File I/O

**Goal:** Practice reading from and writing to files in Python, including CSV manipulation and image processing.

---

### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `lines.py` | Counts non-blank, non-comment lines in a Python file. |
| `pizza.py` | Displays pizza menu items from a CSV file in a neatly formatted table. |
| `scourgify.py` | Reads a messy CSV with combined name fields and outputs a cleaned version with first and last names separated. |
| `shirt.py` | Uses Pillow to place a shirt image overlay on a user-provided photo, saving the result as a new image. |

### 💡 Key Concepts
- `with open()` context managers  
- Reading/writing text and CSV files  
- Exception handling for file access  
- Using external libraries (`csv`, `sys`, `Pillow`)
