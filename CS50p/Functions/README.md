### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `indoor.py` | Converts user input to lowercase text. Demonstrates `input()` and string methods. |
| `playback.py` | Replaces spaces with `...` to simulate speech speed. |
| `einstein.py` | Calculates energy (E = m × c²) based on user-provided mass. |
| `bank.py` | Reads a greeting and returns \$0, \$20, or \$100 depending on politeness. |
| `meal.py` | Determines meal time (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) from a time input like `7:30`. |
