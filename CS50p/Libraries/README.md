# 📚 CS50p — Libraries & APIs

**Goal:** Learn how to import, use, and integrate Python libraries — both built-in and external — to perform real tasks.

---

### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `emojize.py` | Converts shortcodes like \`:smile:\` into emojis using the `emoji` library. |
| `adieu.py` | Takes a list of names as input and prints “Adieu, adieu, to...” dynamically. |
| `professor.py` | A math quiz that generates random problems and handles incorrect answers. |
| `bitcoin.py` | Fetches Bitcoin price via **Coindesk API** using the `requests` library, then multiplies by user input. |

---

### 💡 Key Concepts
- Importing and using standard libraries (`random`, `sys`, `requests`)  
- Installing and using external packages via `pip`  
- API requests and JSON parsing  
- Loops, exception handling, and user input validation
