# 🐍 CS50P – Python Programming

This folder contains my solutions for **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python (Harvard)**.
Focus: Python fundamentals, functions, exceptions, unit tests, file I/O, regex, OOP, and more.

## 📁 Structure
Each `WeekXX` directory contains exercises grouped by topic. Example mapping:
- `Week00` – Functions, variables
- `Week01` – Conditionals
- `Week02` – Loops
- `Week03` – Exceptions
- `Week04` – Libraries & unit testing
- `Week05` – File I/O
- `Week06` – Regular expressions
- `Week07` – OOP (classes)
- `Week08` – Et cetera / Final project prep

## ▶️ Running
```bash
python script.py
```

If a folder includes tests:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest -q
```
