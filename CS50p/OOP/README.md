# 🧱 CS50p — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Goal:** Learn to design programs using classes and objects, encapsulating data and behavior for cleaner, more scalable code.

### 🧩 Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `seasons.py` | Defines a class to calculate the total number of minutes lived since birth using the `datetime` module. |
| `jar.py` | Implements a `Jar` class with `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `__str__()` methods. Demonstrates encapsulation and state validation. |
| `shirtificate.py` | Uses the `fpdf` library to generate a personalized PDF certificate with user input. |

### 💡 Key Concepts
- Class creation and object instantiation  
- Instance variables and methods  
- Encapsulation and validation  
- Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`)  
- External library integration (`fpdf`)

### ▶️ Run examples
```bash
python seasons.py
python jar.py
python shirtificate.py
```

### 💬 What I Learned
How to think in terms of objects, structure data and logic together, and build reusable, maintainable Python code — essential for large applications.
